# 🤖 Finetuning LLMS

In this repo, we'll take own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.

### ⚙️The colab link to the code is found and (will also be included in this repo) [here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OR0dpmer4AFPwvKvA3e5dW8C_lU8o2D3?usp=sharing)

# ⚙️The Build Process (Deliverables)

### Build 🏗️
* Understand when to apply finetuning on LLMs
* Prepare your data for finetuning
* Train and evaluate an LLM on your data
